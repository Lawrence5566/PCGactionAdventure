make adding enemys, add to the whole part of that route (one in each room)?

-make enemys in definate center of room? (at the moment you just get middle room value)
-make hidden route more obvious (with blurry effect)
-think about if 2 keys are generated - make sure 2 lock and keys work together
-visualise monster changes/mods
-lock on to enemys cursor
-remove that flask action button?
-scale monsters with health?

what about?:
if two empty rooms are connected (meaning the player would have to walk through them doing nothing)
then: 	add environment changes for player to look at
	or something interesting
	add hp pickup?


initial notes:
play is fine, focus on finding way to add more stuff into the level?
	needs at least 3 enemy spawns?
	fill empty rooms

*like dormans, make it so 2 patterns work together?*

basic fog + SUN?

patrolling AI?

Inventory?

ambient sounds/sounds?


made sure boss room only ever has boss token or lock in it
adding monsters to every room in a dangerous route (on the short route)
added traps to every connection in short route in a alternative trap route
added UI to show monsters stats when locked on
cleared up some errors including:
	changed restart level to use non-obsolete sceneManager
made str & def impactful (actually does something now)
