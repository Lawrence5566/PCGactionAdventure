-make enemys in definate center of room? (at the moment you just get middle room value)

-> better yet, find way to pick location in the room :D

-make hidden route more obvious (with blurry effect)
-think about if 2 keys are generated 
-make sure 2 lock and keys work together
-visualise monster changes/mods
-lock on to enemys cursor

-remove that flask action button?

-scale monsters with health?


-finalise crosshair mechanics (not sprite just how it works)
-weapon pickups (just spawn some weapons and make them pickupable for now (spawn one randomly in an empty room?))
-make sure that the room that dramatic cycle looks at has something interesting in (or just make sure it only works if it connects to the goal)

what about?:

if two empty rooms are connected (meaning the player would have to walk through them doing nothing)
then:
add environment changes for player to look at
 or something interesting

add hp pickup?




initial notes:

play is fine, focus on finding way to add more stuff into the level?

needs at least 3 enemy spawns?

fill empty rooms

*like dormans, make it so 2 patterns work together?*

basic fog + SUN?


patrolling AI?


Inventory?


ambient sounds/sounds?
