To do list:
-Make PCG into more of a game:
	-weapon/item patterns (eg. hp)
	-weapon pickups
	-weapon of different types doing different damage mechanics
	-weapons type VFX
	-"if empty room" patterns - add something interesting!
	-inventory / item pickup system
-needs at least 3 enemy spawns?
 (and make sure enemys are distributed properly (level2 means nothing atm (get rid of level? (scale off hp instead))))
-basic fog + SUN?
-patrolling AI? (+ patrolling pattern)
-make hidden route more obvious (with blurry effect)
-think about if 2 keys are generated 
-make sure 2 lock and keys work together
-visualise monster changes/mods
-lock on to enemys cursor

-remove that flask action button?

-scale monsters with health?


-finalise crosshair mechanics (not sprite just how it works)
-weapon pickups (just spawn some weapons and make them pickupable for now (spawn one randomly in an empty room?))
-make sure that the room that dramatic cycle looks at has something interesting in (or just make sure it only works if it connects to the goal)
-second iteration patterns (create mini patterns within routes?)

-ambient sounds/sound fx?
