to do:
-finish dramtic cycle

-create collapssing bridge or falling floor - make all passage ways bridges? (make passage ways bigger and just add a bridge, and make seperate floors for each room)

-find a way to make fissures in the ground with the 2 int
-spawn collapsing bridge where required
-spawn traps
-spawn enemies
-spawn player
-spawn blocked route

-open up blocked route once player finds key, also trigger boss to 'unstone' if lock is in goal etc
