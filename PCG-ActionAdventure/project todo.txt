recent changelog:
+ Fixed lock and key cycle adding lock on wrong connection from key / removing wrong connection TO key
+ TreasureRoom pattern change to include traps

To do list (must ("decent state")):   --Oh, and DON'T FORGET TO BUG FIX ALONG THE WAY
-slow wind-up but bigger (definatly hitting) boss attacks
-fix colliders for hitting player in rolling (change collider size or make player invunrable while rolling?) (latter is more true to dark souls)
-fix boss colliders/attacks to hit the player when he's standing still (might need the attacks to visibly aim at the player? or just collider issue)
	-for this we want colliders of weapons to be the right size, just change how boss aims instead? 
-make hidden route more obvious (with blurry effect)
-think about if 2 keys are generated 
-remove that flask action button?
-finalise crosshair mechanics & sprite
-sound fx (hidden wall sounds?, fight sounds, etc)

after this stuff:	create video of game / get people to test

to do list (could):
-make prefabs for a weapon pickup (spinning sword that uses script to pick sword and type etc?) (can you use spinning animation from hp pickup?)
-weapon pickups - make script and patterns to decide what type of item to drop player (need to write 'dealing with items')
-make hp and item pickups more common? (maybe they need to be more common in second level etc)
-make sure that the room that dramatic cycle looks at has something interesting in (or just make sure it only works if it connects to the goal (mayube check and add something interesting?))
-balancing of weapons and enemies etc
-Fix dramtic cycle to work with BFS
-make sure BFS works after all cycle stuff (e.g if any routes are removed make surte it takes account of that (by running after all graph stuff))

To do list (maybe/ none portfolio stuff (after applying to jobs or for fun)):
-weapon of different types doing different damage mechanics
-weapons type VFX
-ambient sounds/background noise?
-"if empty room" patterns - add something interesting!
-inventory / multiple weapon pickup system
-switch weapons system (inventory UI and weapon UI)
-basic fog + SUN?
-patrolling AI? (+ patrolling pattern)
-make sure 2 lock and keys work together
-visualise monster changes/mods
-lock on to enemys cursor
-second iteration patterns (create mini patterns within routes?)


To add to readme:
-add this as a feature to readme - make enemy weapons given depending on modifiers, eg, increased strength gives broadsword etc - show flashy images (create folder for images in repository)?
-Add enemys being stronger as the level progresses (further from player tololology wise?) to readme

extended Game stuff?:
each level you play, you get a new one with 1 level higher difficulty.
at each end, you select a skill from skill tree? (do we need a progression system? (out of scope?))
