recent changelog:
+ Fixed small bug in graphToMapConverter checking if connection had been visited
+ Built app

to do list (could):
-add skill points type thing in - player gets one of the skills (they chose) of the monsters they kill by using an ability on their dead bodies?
-sound fx (hidden wall sounds?, fight sounds, etc)
-make hp and item pickups more common? (maybe they need to be more common in second level etc)
-make sure that the room that dramatic cycle looks at has something interesting in (or just make sure it only works if it connects to the goal (mayube check and add something interesting?))
-make lock on targets switchable with bumpers (inputs already there)
-balancing of weapons and enemies etc
-Fix dramtic cycle to work with BFS
-make sure BFS works after all cycle stuff (e.g if any routes are removed make surte it takes account of that (by running after all graph stuff))

To do list (maybe):
-chain/combo attacks instead of different buttons for player
-weapon of different types doing different damage mechanics
-weapons type VFX
-ambient sounds/background noise?
-"if empty room" patterns - add something interesting!
-Add clause to stop weapons/items/enemies occasionaly spawning on top of each other (cus they pick a random spot inside circle)
-inventory / multiple weapon/item/key pickup system
-switch weapons system (inventory UI and weapon UI)
-basic fog + SUN?
-Gameplay Balancing - write out system to balance properly
-patrolling AI? (+ patrolling pattern)
-chain attacks for enemies?
-more AI changes (smarter)
-make sure 2 lock and keys work together
-visualise monster changes/mods
-lock on to enemys cursor
-second iteration patterns (create mini patterns within routes?)


To add to readme:
-add this as a feature to readme - make enemy weapons given depending on modifiers, eg, increased strength gives broadsword etc - show flashy images (create folder for images in repository)?
-Add enemys being stronger as the level progresses (further from player tololology wise?) to readme

extended Game stuff?:
each level you play, you get a new one with 1 level higher difficulty.
at each end, you select a skill from skill tree? (do we need a progression system? (out of scope?))
