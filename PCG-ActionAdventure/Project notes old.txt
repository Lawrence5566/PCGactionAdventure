PCG graph generator
	-when you generate your routes between start and goal, these are the set of 'tasks'. Randomly apply a random number of paterns to the graph to alter the routes (see figure 8, page 4 of 'level design as model transformations'). This is normally meant to be applied to a 'mission' graph. But by constraining it to the 12 node graph you have, you are plotting out a 'spaces' graph at the same time

	-patterns should accopunt for loops in routes (if previous completed this might not be important)

	-spawn enemies generator must use contraints from mission graph (so it knows the number of spots it has to distribute points)
		 - take total map points and split them eg with a 100 point map (just examples):
			2 spawns: 	30  70			
			3 spawns:	15  35  50

Souls-like player interactions/animations/controls
	-there are animation events on each animation that decide when to open and close colliders(when to start dealing damage during the animation)
	-the only drawback is if the animation cancels, ofc no damage will be dealt if iot doesnt get to the frame where the collider is opened

	Things you didn't implemenent
	-Souls-like Part 5 Lock 'N' Roll #2 - roll tweaks and lockon on different bodyparts
	-Souls-like Part 8 Enemy Interactions Base - at 40mins more rolling changes

-if key on goal node, make the goal only achivable when key is collected (eg if its a monster, keep the monster in stone till key is found)
-open up blocked route once player finds key

-for unknown return, just make the floor fall from benath them
-talk about in report, that this could be changed depending on environment(bridge, building collapsing, river bursting etc) to make the player not realise its random generated and see the pattern
