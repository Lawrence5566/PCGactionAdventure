to do:

-create different levels of enemy (lvl1,2,3,4,5)
-create enemy AI

-create enenmy spawn points

-create collapssing bridge or falling floor - make all passage ways bridges? (make passage ways bigger and just add a bridge, and make seperate floors for each room)

-spawn collapsing bridge where required
-spawn blocked route


does it do this?:
-for lock and key cycle close off the longer route and make player walk all the way round past the door to find the key (which will be placed inside the last cycle node)
	-upon finding the key however, you could make the closed off route open up, giving the player quicker acess to the door
