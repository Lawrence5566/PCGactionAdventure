 
recent changelog:
+ Faster rotate speed for player
+ Faster run speed for player
+ Roll speed and roll distance now properly editable
+ Horizontal move speed when lock-on clamped at 0.85 (to stop player side stepping as fast as they move forward)
+ Increased BoxManEnemy's mass to 100 while not in ragdoll mode so player can't push them around
+ Added/Modified animation events for gs_oh_attack_1, gs_th_attack_1, th_attack_1, th_attack2
+ Gave all weapon prefabs their default material (element type of 'none')

To do list:
-make prefabs for a weapon pickup (spinning sword that uses script to pick sword and type etc?)
-slow wind-up but bigger (definatly hitting) boss attacks
-fix colliders for hitting player in rolling (change collider size or make player invunrable while rolling?) (latter is more true to dark souls)
-fix boss colliders/attacks to hit the player when he's standing still (might need the attacks to visibly aim at the player? or just collider issue)
	-for this we want colliders of weapons to be the right size, just change how boss aims instead? 
-weapon pickups - make script to decide what type of item to drop player
-make weapon pickups work
-weapon of different types doing different damage mechanics
-weapons type VFX
-"if empty room" patterns - add something interesting!
-inventory / item pickup system
-make sure enemys are distributed properly - (level2 means nothing atm (get rid of level? (scale off hp instead))))
-basic fog + SUN?
-patrolling AI? (+ patrolling pattern)
-make hidden route more obvious (with blurry effect)
-think about if 2 keys are generated 
-make sure 2 lock and keys work together
-visualise monster changes/mods
-lock on to enemys cursor

-remove that flask action button?

-scale monsters with health?


-finalise crosshair mechanics (not sprite just how it works)
-weapon pickups (just spawn some weapons and make them pickupable for now (spawn one randomly in an empty room?))
-make sure that the room that dramatic cycle looks at has something interesting in (or just make sure it only works if it connects to the goal)
-second iteration patterns (create mini patterns within routes?)

-ambient sounds/sound fx
