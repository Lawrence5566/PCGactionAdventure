## What this project is about:
Procedual Content Generation – generating something algorithmically – has seen little use in the Action-Adventure genre but new techniques such as Joris Dorman’s cyclic dungeon generation offer an interesting new chance to see an effective PCG Action-Adventure game. This project aims to use Dorman’s cycles alongside a points-based scaling distribution and cellular automata to create an Action-Adventure game that uses PCG effectively. Using Unity with C# this project can create a 2D implementation of a graph node generator - to show maps of the level and how the maps are being generated and a system to convert that graph to a 3D level. The game includes boss battles, souls like combat and more. A study using play testers found that there was some suggestive evidence to show patterns like Dorman’s and cellular automata can be effective in Action-Adventure games but scaling distribution requires further study to find anything tangible as the version of this project at the time didn't spawn enough enemies to test it.
